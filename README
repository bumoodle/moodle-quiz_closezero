Close and Zero Attempts Report
Allows an instructor to easily close attempts- including the ability to close all overdue exams in two clicks.
Also allows instructors to create "null" or "zero" attempts for users who did not attempt the quiz- which will allow them to review a quiz as though they had submitted an empty quiz.

Will include a cron script which can be used to automatically close/zero quiz attempts afte  their due date.
